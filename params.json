Schuller (**A thorough introduction to the theory of general relativity**) introducing the mathematical and physical foundations of the theory in 24 self-contained lectures at the International Winter School on Gravity and Light in Linz/Austria for the WE Heraeus International Winter School of Gravity and Light, 2015 in Linz as part of the world-wide celebrations of the 100th anniversary of Einstein's theory of general relativity and the International Year of Light 2015.\r\n\r\nThese lectures develop the theory from first principles and aim at an audience ranging from ambitious undergraduate students to beginning PhD students in mathematics and physics. Satellite Lectures (see other videos on this channel) by Bernard F Schutz (Gravitational Waves), Domenico Giulini (Canonical Formulation of Gravity), Marcus C Werner (Gravitational Lensing) and Valeria Pettorino (Cosmic Microwave Background) expand on the topics of this central lecture course and take students to the research frontier.\r\n\r\nI agree with [Ernest Yeung](https://github.com/ernestyalumni) that these lectures are \"unequivocally, the best, most lucid, and well-constructed lecture series on General Relativity and Gravity\". This repository has been created by forking his repository [ernestyalumni/Gravite](https://github.com/ernestyalumni/Gravite).\r\n\r\n----------\r\n### Why this fork\r\nThe initial purpose of this fork is the following:\r\n* to confine the output pdf only to lectures\r\n* using the documentclass{article} in A4 paper\r\n* put each lecture/tutorial in its own file\r\n* filling in missing parts in lectures or to modify existing parts to suit me better\r\n\r\n----------","google":"UA-60481594-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
